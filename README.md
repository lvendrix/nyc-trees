# Data cleaning project - NYC Trees

## Intro

The Department of Environmental Conservation, from New York City, has recently made the news by telling the people that they needed their help. Indeed, their request is simple: They needed the people of New York City, whether young or old, to go to the nearest tree in their street and gather information about that tree. This is all in an effort to make the population aware that nature is important, even in big Metropolis like NYC. Now that they have heard back from the people, the DEC noticed that they missed a crucial step. They forgot to give the people a data collection guide, and so the data they received back is a bit messy.

Can you help them clean the data so that they can begin to raise awareness to ecological issues, such as climate change ?

## Mission objectives

- Clean the data set (check for input errors, spelling mistakes, ...)
- Prepare the data for machine learning

## Database

For this data cleaning project, we are working with a sample of the database '2015 Street Tree Census - Tree Data' provided by the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR). The original database has information about 684k trees. In our sample, we have 100k trees (14,62%). The original database can be accessed here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh

## Tools used

- Pandas
